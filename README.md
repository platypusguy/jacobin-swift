# jacobin

A more-than-minimal JVM written in Swift. 

[This overview](https://github.com/platypusguy/jacobin/wiki/Jacobin-Overview) gives the background on this project, including its aspirations and the features that it supports. The remaining pages discuss the basics of JVM operation and, where applicable, how Jacobin implements the various steps, noting any items that would be of particular interest to JVM cognoscenti. I've included references to the official JVM docs, where I can both as a reference for you, the reader, and for the Jacobin team's easy reference.
